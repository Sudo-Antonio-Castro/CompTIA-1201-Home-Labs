# Installing System Devices

## Key Concepts
* Differentiate types of RAM and installation considerations (DDR, DDR4, ECC)
* Understand the installation and configuration of storage devices (HDD, SSD, NVMe)
* Identify optical drives and their connection methods
* Recognize input/output devices and their installation (keyboards, mice, webcams)
* Understand peripheral device connections (USB, Thunderbolt, FireWire)
* Identify display device types and connectors (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, DVI)
* Understand expansion cards and their purpose (graphics, sound, network)

## Tools Needed:
1. VirtualBox or VMware
2. Use VM settings to "add RAM" or "attach a virtual storage device"

## Setup Steps:
1. Create a VM and adjust RAM allocation to simulate adding/removing memory.
2. Add or remove virtual hard disks to simulate installing storage devices.
3. Use VM BIOS/UEFI setup screens to observe device recognition

# Alternative Lab

1. Add or remove removable RAM modules or storage drives from your own PC
2. Use device manager or system info to see installed devices
